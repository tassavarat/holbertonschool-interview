# 0x17. Find the Loop

## Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* No standard library functions allowed. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
* In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded
* Please use this data structure for this project:
```
/**
 * struct listint_s - singly linked list
 * @n: integer
 * @next: points to the next node
 *
 * Description: singly linked list node structure
 * for Holberton project
 */
typedef struct listint_s
{
    int n;
    struct listint_s *next;
} listint_t;
```

### [0. Find the loop](./0-find_loop.c)
Write a function that finds the loop in a linked list.

    Prototype: `listint_t *find_listint_loop(listint_t *head);`
    Returns: The address of the node where the loop starts, or `NULL` if there is no loop
    You are not allowed to use `malloc`, `free` or arrays
    You can only declare a maximum of two variables in your function

Note: In order to compile the main file, you are provided with [this static library](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/RW8Tg5QdvyYGK-K0qXxSiw). This library won’t be used during the correction; Its only purpose is for testing.
